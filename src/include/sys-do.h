// The primary routine that performs DO and DO/NEXT is called Eval_Core().  It
// takes a single parameter which holds the running state of the evaluator.
// This state may be allocated on the C variable stack:  fail() is
// written such that a longjmp up to a failure handler above it can run
// safely and clean up even though intermediate stacks have vanished.
//
// Ren-C can run the evaluator across a REBARR-style series of input based on
// index.  It can also enumerate through C's `va_list`, providing the ability
// to pass pointers as REBVAL* to comma-separated input at the source level.
// (Someday it may fetch values from a standard C array of REBVAL[] as well.) 
//
// To provide even greater flexibility, it allows the very first element's
// pointer in an evaluation to come from an arbitrary source.  It doesn't
// have to be resident in the same sequence from which ensuing values are
// pulled, allowing a free head value (such as an ACTION! REBVAL in a local
// C variable) to be evaluated in combination from another source (like a
// va_list or series representing the arguments.)  This avoids the cost and
// complexity of allocating a series to combine the values together.
//
// These features alone would not cover the case when REBVAL pointers that
// are originating with C source were intended to be supplied to a function
// with no evaluation.  In R3-Alpha, the only way in an evaluative context
// to suppress such evaluations would be by adding elements (such as QUOTE).
// Besides the cost and labor of inserting these, the risk is that the
// intended functions to be called without evaluation, if they quoted
// arguments would then receive the QUOTE instead of the arguments.
//
// The problem was solved by adding a feature to the evaluator which was
// also opened up as a new privileged native called EVAL.  EVAL's refinements
// completely encompass evaluation possibilities in R3-Alpha, but it was also
// necessary to consider cases where a value was intended to be provided
// *without* evaluation.  This introduced EVAL/ONLY.
//


// !!! Find a better place for this!

//  DO's LOWEST-LEVEL EVALUATOR HOOKING

//
// This API is used internally in the implementation of Eval_Core.  It does
// not speak in terms of arrays or indices, it works entirely by setting
// up a call frame (f), and threading that frame's state through successive
// operations, vs. setting it up and disposing it on each DO/NEXT step.
//
// Like higher level APIs that move through the input series, this low-level
// API can move at full DO/NEXT intervals.  Unlike the higher APIs, the
// possibility exists to move by single elements at a time--regardless of
// if the default evaluation rules would consume larger expressions.  Also
// making it different is the ability to resume after a DO/NEXT on value
// sources that aren't random access (such as C's va_arg list).
//
// One invariant of access is that the input may only advance.  Before any
// operations are called, any low-level client must have already seeded
// f->value with a valid "fetched" REBVAL*.
//
// This privileged level of access can be used by natives that feel they can
// optimize performance by working with the evaluator directly.

//     Hello
//
//     >> foo: func [x] [print x]

//
// When the branch is single-arity, the condition which triggered the branch
